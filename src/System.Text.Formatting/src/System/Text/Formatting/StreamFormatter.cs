        // I would like to lazy write to the stream, but unfortunatelly this seems to be exclusive with this type being a struct. 
        // If the write was lazy, passing this struct by value could result in data loss.
        // A stack frame could write more data to the buffer, and then when the frame pops, the infroamtion about how much was written could be lost. 
        // On the other hand, I cannot make this type a class and keep using it as it can be used today (i.e. pass streams around and create instances of this type on demand).
        // Too bad we don't support move semantics and stack only structs.
